      <h2>Profile</h2>
      <p>
        For over thirty years, I have worked across public administration, defence, and regulated industries, designing adaptive digital architectures capable of integrating complexity, sustainability, and regulatory compliance. My training in the Italian Air Force instilled in me a rigorous methodological approach and a strong sense of responsibility—qualities I apply daily by working alongside executive leadership to align strategy, processes, and technological infrastructures. My work focuses on managing complex projects that require an integrated view of organisational processes and knowledge flows. I am committed to knowledge governance, data-oriented systems, and transformation programmes. I contribute to the Stultifera Navis project, where I explore the connections between memory, systems thinking, and digital responsibility.

            oct 1996 – oct 2022<br>
            <p style="margin-top:0.5em;">
              From 1996 to 2022, I worked as an independent consultant, supporting over 200 organisations across public administration, defence, finance, and industry. I always operated with full autonomy—reporting directly to senior management, leading complex initiatives, and taking responsibility for both technical solutions and organisational change.
            </p>
            <p>
              My work focused on knowledge governance, digital architectures, and adaptive project management systems. I was the first professional in Italy to structure project governance using Jira and BigPicture, years before their widespread adoption. Alongside project delivery, I delivered over 7,000 hours of training—both in classroom settings and personalised coaching—helping professionals and teams adopt tools and methods with critical understanding and operational clarity. This profile includes a curated selection of key assignments—chosen for their systemic relevance, impact on strategic transformation, and tangible outcomes.

              <p style="margin-top:0.5em;">
                In the defence sector, I designed and coordinated digital solutions to support document management, information security, and the integration of administrative and operational processes. For the Italian Army between 2004 and 2005, and for the Italian Navy between 2011 and 2013, I contributed to the implementation of document dematerialisation solutions compliant with both civil and military regulations, overseeing the entire document lifecycle: acquisition, classification, registration, electronic signature, semantic annotation of metadata, compliant archiving, and full traceability. The initiative involved both central structures and distributed units, with an approach aimed at ensuring operational sustainability, administrative continuity, and regulatory oversight of the information processed.

              <p style="margin-top:0.5em;">
                I designed and implemented Jira- and Confluence-based solutions for IT service management, developing custom workflows for tasks such as account provisioning, database configuration, hardware tracking (IT Asset Management and CMDB), and operational support. I streamlined cross-team processes through automation, enhancing consistency, traceability, and response times. In parallel, I supported the Legal Department in reorganising internal documentation on Confluence, creating structured spaces and intuitive templates for corporate directives and policies.

              <p style="margin-top:0.5em;">
                Specialist support for digital transformation and integration of project management tools.<br>
                As an expert in Agile methodologies and the Disciplined Agile framework, I supported consulting firms involved in ENEL’s digital transformation initiatives. My role focused on designing and implementing operational integrations between Jira, Atlassian tools, and project portfolio management systems such as Primavera P6. I contributed to scaling Agile practices in regulated, multi-vendor environments by translating strategic goals into concrete application solutions, with particular emphasis on governance alignment, traceability, and cross-functional workflow coordination.

              <p style="margin-top:0.5em;">
                I led the integrated introduction of Jira, Tempo, and BigPicture to enable effective portfolio management in multi-team environments. I worked closely with project, product, and delivery functions to redefine tracking mechanisms, planning processes, and cross-functional visibility. The initiative included workflow customisation, the development of executive dashboards, and the automation of departmental engagement rules across intake and execution cycles. Thanks to integration with Scrum practices and a value-oriented setup, the system delivered tangible benefits in terms of decision-making transparency, estimation accuracy, and cross-functional coordination.

              <p style="margin-top:0.5em;">
                At Seat Pagine Gialle (now Italiaonline), I led the adoption of Agile practices within the Systems &amp; Release department, supporting cross-functional teams in the development of a customised Scrum methodology, which was also extended to testing and release processes. I managed the technical governance of Atlassian tools (Jira, Confluence, Bamboo), already in use within the company, optimising their application from a DevOps perspective and integrating them with Jenkins, combining system administration skills with organisational coaching. I promoted the use of R and Splunk for predictive analysis purposes, contributing to enhanced operational resilience and improved application release.

              jul 1999 – sep 2010<br>
              <p style="margin-top:0.5em;">
                I supported the Sicilian Regional Government in adopting open-source technologies with high economic sustainability, achieving significant savings by replacing proprietary software with free solutions and reusing existing hardware. As an expert in the PAFlow document management platform, I led the introduction of interoperable tools compliant with current regulations, training managers and civil servants in digital registration, electronic signature, long-term archiving, and document classification. This approach anticipated by nearly ten years the model of the “digital citizen dossier” (and the IO app — the application for interoperability of Italian public services).

        Technical writing and critical reflection on technology<br>
        aug 1986 – oct 2022<br>
        <p style="margin-top:0.5em;">
          Alongside my professional career, I have consistently cultivated a keen interest in technical writing, scientific communication, and the philosophy of knowledge and technological responsibility. During the 1990s, I contributed to a range of specialist publications, including CQ Elettronica, Linux Journal, Elettronica Flash, Radio Rivista, RadioKit Elettronica, Ubuntu Magazine, Windows &amp; .Net Magazine, Hackin9, and Red Hat Magazine, writing on subjects such as the Linux operating system, software-defined radio (SDR), cybersecurity, open source culture, and IT governance.<br>
          In 1999, I was among the first to introduce Linux to the Italian amateur radio community, advocating the use of free software in both scientific and educational settings.<br>
          Today, I contribute to the Stultifera Navis project, where I explore the interplay between systems thinking, technical mediation, and institutional memory, with particular attention to the materiality of information and emerging digital epistemologies.

        Italian Air Force<br>
        oct 1991 – jun 1996<br>
        <p style="margin-top:0.5em;">
          I joined the Italian Air Force in October 1991 and attended the Air Force War College (Scuola di Guerra Aerea) in Florence, before specialising in telecommunications at the Technical Training Unit (Reparto Tecnico Addestrativo) of the 14th Wing (14° Stormo) in Pratica di Mare. I was subsequently assigned to the 41st Anti-Submarine Warfare Wing (41° Stormo Antisom) in Sigonella, where I served as Officer in Charge of the Operational Services Unit. Upon promotion to the rank of Lieutenant (Tenente), I assumed command of a NATO Communications Centre (ACCAM). For two consecutive years, I also held the additional role of Director of the Officers’ Club and the officers’ and NCO messes. During this period, I worked with the Information and Operational Situation Service (S.I.O.S.), the 34th RADAR Group (34° Gruppo RADAR), and the 11th Aircraft Maintenance Unit (11° Reparto Manutenzione Velivoli) as a telecommunications and radio signal analysis specialist. I was honourably discharged in May 1995 and received a formal commendation for exemplary conduct and outstanding service. Until June 1996, I continued to support operations as an external consultant, ensuring continuity and providing training on custom software solutions for document management and information analysis that I had developed.
