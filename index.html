      <h2>Profile</h2>
      <p>
        For over thirty years, I have worked across public administration, defence, and regulated industries, designing adaptive digital architectures capable of integrating complexity, sustainability, and regulatory compliance. My training in the Italian Air Force instilled in me a rigorous methodological approach and a strong sense of responsibility—qualities I apply daily by working alongside executive leadership to align strategy, processes, and technological infrastructures. My work focuses on managing complex projects that require an integrated view of organisational processes and knowledge flows. I am committed to knowledge governance, data-oriented systems, and transformation programmes. I contribute to the Stultifera Navis project, where I explore the connections between memory, systems thinking, and digital responsibility.

            Oct 1996 – Oct 2022 · 26 years 1 month
            <p style="margin-top:0.5em;">
              From 1996 to 2022, I worked as an independent consultant, supporting over 200 organisations across public administration, defence, finance, and industry. I always operated with full autonomy—reporting directly to senior management, leading complex initiatives, and taking responsibility for both technical solutions and organisational change.
            </p>
            <p>
              My work focused on knowledge governance, digital architectures, and adaptive project management systems. I was the first professional in Italy to structure project governance using Jira and BigPicture, years before their widespread adoption.<br>
              Alongside project delivery, I delivered over 7,000 hours of training—both in classroom settings and personalised coaching—helping professionals and teams adopt tools and methods with critical understanding and operational clarity.
